[openrocketengine](https://github.com/cmflannery/openrocketengine) is an open source project designed to help with the design and development of liquid rocket engines.

## Release Notes
__Pre-release - Version 0.0.2__

## Contribution guidlines
Community support is welcome.

For __problems__ with calculations and equations, open an __issue__ and I'll correct it.

For __improvements__ to algorithms, create a __pull request__ that details what has been changed.

For all other contributions, use issues and pull requests at your discretion.

## Verification and Validation
openrocketengine undergoes verification and validation testing in accordance to IEEE 1012-2012.

#### Current Challenges
What parameters need to be optimized, and what is an optimized engine design?
</br>
__Parameters to Optimize__
* thrust/weight ratio
* material cost
* manufacturing difficulty (this will be difficult)

#### 3D Modeling
Eventually, I want <code>openrocketengine</code> to output a generic IGES file given the chamber dimensions and design.

#### Design Iteration and Testing
openrocketengine should have the ability to take test data inputs and use that information to improve the engine model.

#### Latex output
Generate latex calculations output using template.

## Licensing
openrocketengine is released under the MIT license.
